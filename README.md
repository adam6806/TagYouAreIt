TagYouAreIt
===========

A plugin for Craftbukkit which allows users to play a "kick the can style" game of tag. One player creates a game and others join. Tag other player by right clicking on them. The right clicking helps to circumvent servers with PVP disabled (like mine :D)

0.1 Crap crap and more crap. Just learning how to make plugins and listeners and such.

0.2 Learned a lot tested a lot. I consider this to be the first actually playable version. So far the "kick the can" functionality hasn't been added yet. Has yet to be tested with more than two people. I'm sure many changes are on their way. Also it is not recommended to play while holding placeable blocks.
